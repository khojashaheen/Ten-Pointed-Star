# Ten-Pointed-Star
This ten-pointed star was created with the help of p5.jsâ€™s vector and map() functions used for the skeleton of the sketch, transform functions used for translating/rotating the polygon by 36degrees (to create a ten-fold-star), and frameCount settings used for the animation effect
